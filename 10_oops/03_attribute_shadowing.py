# Create an object (instance) of class Chai

# Accessing class attribute via instance

# Override the class attribute on THIS instance only
cutting.temperature = "Mild"  # now instance has its own 'temperature'

print("After changing ", cutting.temperature)  # Output: Mild
print("Cup size is  ", cutting.cup)            # Output: Small

# Looking directly at the class attribute
print("Direct look into the class ", Chai.temperature)  # Output: Hot


# Delete the instance attributes
del cutting.temperature   # removes the instance-level 'temperature'
del cutting.cup           # removes the instance-level 'cup'

print(cutting.temperature)
# Since instance attribute 'temperature' was deleted,
# Python falls back to the class attribute â†’ Output: Hot

print(cutting.cup)
# 'cup' was never a class attribute, only an instance attribute.
# After deletion, Python looks into the class but doesn't find 'cup',
# So it raises: AttributeError: 'Chai' object has no attribute 'cup'
